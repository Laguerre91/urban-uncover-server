Located in the city center, close to tourist attractions such as the Brandenburg Gate, it is, with its 210 meters, larger than London's Hyde Park. This park is a meeting point for walks, family picnics, playing ball or simply resting for a while. In summer, every Sunday you can hear the carillon bells.",
